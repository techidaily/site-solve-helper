## What is iMovie?

[iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is an Apple video editing software which only runs on the Macintosh operating system. As the basic video editing solution from Apple, it is quite novice-friendly and allows users to create movies from a number of different sources including digital video cameras, DV-encoded files, and images and do various simple tasks to the videos like add video titles, perform simple transitions etc. 

### Pros and Cons of iMoive

Pros:

User friendly and easy to use and learn. Even if you are a newbie, you can start editing videos with iMovie right away, however time would be taken if you want to get the hang of it. You are allowed to add some effects and background music, combine several photos at once, and organize your videos to experience great function of this video editing software.

Friendly interface. The organized function layout and design on its friendly interface give you great convenience when you are editing your videos.

Convenient videos sharing. You are allowed to share and publish your edited videos on videos sites like YouTube, Facebook and Vimeo directly with iMovie.

Cons:

According to most Apple's products owners, not all varieties of MP4 are supported by iMovie due to its incompatibility, in addition to many other video formats. This issue is no doubt quite annoying as MP4 today is one of the most popular and most used video formats.

The storage space is quite limited which leads to difficulty if you have large number of projects. So you will need external hard drive soon.

iMovie doesn't perform quite stably. Sometimes, [iMovie keeps crashing](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) when editing videos on Mac and iOS devices.

## What is Final Cut Pro?

[Final Cut Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), as suggested by its name, is a completely new, faster, more intuitive and sophisticated video editing software made for Apple users. When it comes to iMovie vs Final Cut Pro, many mac users will prefer the latter, especially for those who need more professional videos such as video journalists and film editors as it provides access to a wide variety of effects and titling options to allow more creativity in video projects. Like iMovie, Final Cut Pro is only available on Mac. 

### Pros and Cons of Final Cut Pro

Pros:

 A powerful video editor to edit both simple and complex videos. It can satisfy almost all your needs about editing videos, both home made or professional purpose, in the way you want.

This video editing software contains many powerful tools such as the magnetic timeline, background processing, good organization tools—ratings, tagging, auto analysis for faces, scenes, and stabilization etc.

Final Cut Pro is able to integrate with Apple's other multimedia editing software included in Final Cut Studio.

Cons:

The film must be saved in a certain type, otherwise the image will mess up.

With more professional options available, the interface and operation inevitably become much complicated than iMovie.

It's only available for the Apple's OS X operating system and no version is made for mobile platform.
