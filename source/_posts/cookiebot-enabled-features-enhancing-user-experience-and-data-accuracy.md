#### _ABBYY solutions help Irish businesses to improve efficiency, maximise business value, and increase time-to-revenue through intelligent data capture, RPA and content intelligence._

[](https://tools.techidaily.com/abbyy/products/)ABBYY®, a global provider of content intelligence solutions and services, today announces its partnership with [Inpute](https://inpute.com/ "Inpute"), Ireland’s leader in intelligent data capture. Inpute is the Irish reseller for ABBYY, providing an enhanced offering to a range of customers by integrating ABBYY products, including FlexiCapture and FineReader, to solve growing business problems.

The Bank of Ireland’s 2018 [Technology Outlook](http://www.isin.ie/assets/91/7591BEB3-D2E2-4E35-921C071A9D0AFFB5%5Fdocument/BankofIreland%5FTech%5FH218.pdf "Technology Outlook")forecast that the Irish tech industry would grow by more than 20 per cent in 2018, expecting revenues across Irish IT services to reach €3.5 billion. For Inpute’s customers, the need for better technology to keep up with this growing trend became clear. The main challenge for businesses still running on older technologies is the impact on business efficiency – functions such as invoice processing are good examples of this.

Manually entering invoice data can cause major issues for businesses, be it inaccuracies caused by human error or the inability to maximise time and cost-efficiency in document-heavy processes. With a Gartner analyst in the Bank of Ireland Technology Outlook finding that “automation is the most meaningful change to the IT services business model since offshoring”, Inpute chose to integrate ABBYY technologies and solutions to alleviate their customers’ issues through automation.

In the procurement and accounts payable function, ABBYY’s FlexiCapture technology pulls data from invoices and feeds them automatically into the Procure to Pay (P2P) system. Once the data has been automatically extracted, it can be stored in a searchable system. This vastly increases the speed at which data can be searched for within the system for future use, speeding up processing times. This automated extraction and processing of data, enabled by ABBYY technologies and solutions can eliminate human error and improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency of AP processing.

Partnering with ABBYY enables Inpute to offer the best possible product suite to customers expecting the height of innovation in a growing Irish technology market. To maintain its lead in the Irish capture market, Inpute needed to offer its clients – including government departments and global organisations – the best software available to solve their business challenges. By integrating ABBYY’s products to their ‘capture first’ approach, Inpute’s customers are empowered to do much more with the data they capture, pulling insights and driving value and results for their business.

“Creating a partnership with ABBYY vastly improves our capture offering to customers across a variety of sectors, including financial services, FMCG, and the public sector,” said Chris Howard, CEO, Inpute. “Beyond just a local view, we now have the backing of a global leader. ABBYY’s technologies and expertise are crucial to us maintaining our market-leading position in Ireland in the changing world of automation. For long-term customers who have been using our tools to solve a range of problems, it’s time to seek out new solutions to address emerging challenges. We are changing the direction of our business, and ABBYY is our future.”

As established innovators in document capture and intelligent data extraction, when entering the Irish market our aim was to find a partner offering innovative solutions and decades of experience in the market,” said Markus Pichler, VP of Global Partnerships at ABBYY Europe. “We’re excited to partner with Inpute to integrate our technologies into some of Ireland’s biggest companies, where we are helping maximise their business efficiency, saving valuable costs, and accelerating their time-to-revenue.”
