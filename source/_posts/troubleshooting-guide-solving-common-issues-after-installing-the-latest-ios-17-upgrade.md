### 38\. Accuracy Issue of iOS 17 Measure App 

The iOS 17 new AR measuring is really awesome and Apple users have a lot of fun playing with it on iOS 17\. But according to The Loop, a blog called Kirkville has tested this feature and found the result is not very accurate. For example, when he measured the same items multiple times, the results differ. Here are two measurements of one of my shakuhachis, one for 51cm, and the other for 57cm, but measuring at the same position and height. 

Frankly, AR Measure App is a good party toy, but little more, in its current state. Note that these measures were taken with an iPhone 8+; I'm not sure if it uses the dual cameras, but if so, the parallax of the dual cameras should make it more accurate than a single camera.
