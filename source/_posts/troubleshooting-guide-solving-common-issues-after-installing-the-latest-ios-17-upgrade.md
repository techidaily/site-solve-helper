### 36\. Safari 403 Forbidden Error 

Some users complain about their Safari is forbidden with a 403 forbidden error after iOS 17 upgrading. It may caused by various reasons like iOS 17 bug, Safari privacy settings, network connection or else. If you have this annoying problem, you can try to: 

1. Update Safari app to the lastest version
2. Check cookie setting. Go to "Settings", then to "Safari" and simply disable "Block All Cookies" setting if it is enabled and showing Green.
3. Deleting history, cookies, and cache of the Safari app is the next thing to do if the above steps fail to offer any help.
4. If all the above steps fail to provide any positive results, checking your network connection specifically the Wi-Fi router (if you use any) is a good idea.

### 38\. Accuracy Issue of iOS 17 Measure App 

The iOS 17 new AR measuring is really awesome and Apple users have a lot of fun playing with it on iOS 17\. But according to The Loop, a blog called Kirkville has tested this feature and found the result is not very accurate. For example, when he measured the same items multiple times, the results differ. Here are two measurements of one of my shakuhachis, one for 51cm, and the other for 57cm, but measuring at the same position and height. 

Frankly, AR Measure App is a good party toy, but little more, in its current state. Note that these measures were taken with an iPhone 8+; I'm not sure if it uses the dual cameras, but if so, the parallax of the dual cameras should make it more accurate than a single camera.
