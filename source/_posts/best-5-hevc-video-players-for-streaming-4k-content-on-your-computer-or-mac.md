## Part 1\. What is HEVC?

HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) is a new video compression standard especially designed to encode high definition videos, like 2.7K, 4K, and 8K videos. Compared to H.264, H.265 approximately doubles the compression ratio to generate roughly half-sized videos, while maintaining the same quality. That’s why more and more hardwares like iPhone, Android, GoPro, DJI, etc. use this codec to encode videos. 

However, the high video compression efficiency also means the increased computational resource occupancy. Usually, HEVC encoding and decoding requires roughly 10x more computer power than H.264 encoding and decoding. That is to say, you also need a powerful computer besides a professional HEVC player.

### No.1: 5KPlayer

* Supported OS: All versions of macOS and Windows (inclu. 10/11)

5KPlayer has a vibrant and creative developer team, which subtly detects users' need to play HEVC videos. Thus, users first. They immediately devote themselves to upgrade 5KPlayer to fully support playing HEVC 8-bit, 10-bit and even 12-bit videos (hardware high end enough) without any extra HEVC codec downloads.

When acting as a HEVC video player, VLC also leverage Hardware Acceleration technologies to allocate the decoding tasks from CPU to GPU to ease the burden of your computer, and at the same time speed up the HEVC video playback.

However, like any other media player, VLC is also imperfect. If your computer configuration is low-end, or you don’t upgrade the computer’s OS to the latest version, you may fail to play HEVC video files. You might need to spend more time and energy to download HEVC codec packs for VLC to beef up your VLC Media Player to be able to play HEVC/H.265 files.

Regardless of the drawbacks, VLC is always the first open-source choice for people to play multimedia files. If needed, you can also stream videos, download files, live stream YouTube, convert formats with this media player software.

## Part 3\. How to Solve HEVC Videos not Playing Issue?

Nothing is perfect. Even if you have downloaded a HEVC video player, there is probably a HEVC video not playing issue. So, you need some help when facing the issue.

### Solution 1\. Upgrade your macOS

As we have explained above, only Mac shipped with macOS High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina, or Big Sur can support HEVC files decoding. So, it is the first step to upgrade your macOS and then play HEVC video files on Mac with the default media player without any other third-party help.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Solution 2\. Install HEVC Video Extension

For Windows 10 or 11 users, you are highly suggested to download the HEVC Video Extension from Microsoft to make the HEVC videos playable on such a platform. With the HEVC codec, your default Windows media player will own the HEVC playback ability. However, you need to pay $9.99 for this installation. Also, the installation can’t be applied to Windows OS before Windows 10.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Solution 3\. Upgrade your hardware

Your computer’s hardware configurations are also very important factors. If your hardware can’t support HEVC/H.265 codec, it is still hard for your HEVC player to decode the highly-compressed video codec. Below lists out the current hardware configurations that support HEVC video decoding and playback. Check if your hardware meets the requirements.

![HEVC supported hardware](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/hevc-hardware-requirements.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Don't feel gloomy if your hardware configuration doesn't address the above needs, for this doesn't mean you're 100% unable to decode HEVC video. Nothing is absolute. Though some computers sport with entry-level CPUs, they might have no problem to decode HEVC video under certain circumstances. Of course, in general, if your computer is "too slow" like snail speed, the chance to decode H265/HEVC video might be slim to zero. So you'd better make sure your hardware configuration is at least qualified (if not excellent enough).

### Solution 4\. Convert H.265 to H.264

There are still cases that you can’t play a HEVC/H.265 video as the above solutions are not very suitable for you. For example, you are not going to upgrade your macOS; the HEVC codec is not compatible with your computer’s OS; or you have no budget to upgrade your hardware. Don’t worry, there is a better way to solve all of the problems. That’s converting H.265 to H.264 with a video converter which nearly all media players and platforms can support.

MacX Video Converter Pro is introduced here to help you to that end. It is 4K video converter for people to convert between file formats so as to play them on a wide range of devices easily. It also has the video compression ability to change video resolution and file size if the video playback is choppy or stuttering. Then, there is no CPU overheating, laptop heavy lag, HEVC video choppy, CPU overuse, etc. headaches.

**Step 1.** Download MacX Video Converter Pro, install and launch it.

**Step 2.** Click on the "Add Video" button to add your HEVC file. Or just drag-and-drop the file. Batch converting is also supported, so you can add more than one file at a time.

**Step 3.** Once the "Ouput Profile" window pops up, choose the output video format. Here, you can choose MP4 H.264 as the output format. 

**Step 4.** Choose the destination folder via "Browse" button to save the converted file, and then hit "RUN" button to begin converting the HEVC file.

## Part 4\. HEVC Playback FAQs

### 1\. Why is my HEVC video not playing?

HEVC file is a heavily compressed video (about double the compression ratio compared with AVC/H.264) so that your computer needs to do far more work per frame to uncompress file data. In other words, HEVC video decoding and playback is much more processor intensive than other formats, like H.264\. If your system is too old to support hardware HEVC/H.265 decoding, and your computer CPU processor doesn't provide fast enough speed to decode HEVC, then you are in high likelihood to meet the HEVC video not playing problem.

Besides a powerful computer, you also need a dedicated HEVC video player that supports HEVC codec to play HEVC video files successfully.

### 2\. Can HEVC play in VLC?

Yes. VLC can play HEVC files. Since version 2.1.1, VLC added HEVC/H.265 support in MKV, MP4, and raw files. So, VLC has the ability to play such HEVC files. However, other format HEVC videos may not be decoded by VLC.

### 3\. How do I play a HEVC video?

You have several ways to play a HEVC video.

Way 1\. Download HEVC/H.265 codec. HEVC codec will help beef up your default media player to compress/decompress videos in HEVC and makes HEVC playback possible. Right now, there are many choices available, such as x265, DivX HEVC, K-Lite Mega codec park, etc.
