**Q:** _I filmed footage on a mini DV tape and put the footage on a DVD. I now want the footage to go onto iMovie, but when I try to drag the footage from the DVD into iMovie, it says: "The file will not be imported. It is not compatible with iMovie." What should I do to make the DVD playable in iMovie?_

_There is a part of a DVD that I want to use in my class. I want to edit it using iMovie, but I have no idea how I can import it into iMovie. There is no option to import DVDs into it as it's not a camera or camcorder. And the protection stuff..._ 

**A:** In order to import the contents of a DVD into iMovie, you need to rip the DVD to an iMovie-supported format, like MPEG-4 (MP4, M4V), MPEG-2, DV, HDV, MOV, and AVCHD. That means **a DVD to iMovie converter is necessary** to help decrypt DVD files for iMovie on Mac.

Based on different demands, namely importing commercial or uncommercial DVDs to iMovie, there are two free DVD rippers to let you convert DVD movies into iMovie friendly formats. Then you can import the DVD movie to iMovie for editing.

![free DVD ripper for iMovie](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/dvd-iphone-free.png) 

**Step 2\. Select an Output Format for iMovie.** 

Once the DVD is imported, an output format will pop up automatically. To convert DVDs for iMovie editing, you can go to **General Video** and select MP4 Video from the list. You can also scroll down the list on the left, choose **Apple Device**, and select **to iMovie Video**. Then choose a ready output format for iMovie from the list on the right. Then click **Done**. 

[iMovie supports the following formats:](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)

H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, ProRes, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MJPEG, M4V, DV, HDV, AVCHD, Apple Intermediate Codec, Apple Animation Codec, XAVC/XAVC, iFrame, some, but not all, varieties of MP4, MOV. 

**Note:** The latest version of iMovie claims to support the HEVC codec. Yet, its compatibility still leaves a lot to be desired based on iMovie users' feedback on forums. As a result, you should select MP4 H264 or MOV H264 as output formats for the time being.

## How to Convert Homemade DVDs to iMovie 

If you need to import a homemade DVD into iMovie on Mac, you can simply use the DVD ripper mentioned above. You can also try the method below. 

**Step 1:** If the DVD doesn't contain DRM, you should be able to double-click on the DVD drive to open it (if the DVD starts to play after you click on it, just close it and try again). Then you will see an Audio\_TS folder and a Video\_TS folder. 

![convert DVD to iMovie handbrake](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/homemade-dvd.jpg) 

 **Step 2:** Double-click on the VIDEO\_TS folder to open it. Then you will see a slew of BUP, IFO, and VOB files. Copy all of the files with the extension .VOB to your Mac. The DVD movies are not copied to your Mac. However, you can't import the DVD VOB to iMovie as it doesn't support the format. So next, you need to convert the DVD VOB to iMovie MP4 using Handbrake. 

![convert DVD to iMovie handbrake](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/dvd-vob.jpg) 

**Step 3:** Handbrake can in fact freely convert homemade DVDs to iMovie MP4\. Free download and install Handbrake. Open it and click the source to load the VOB files on your Mac. (You can skip Steps 1 and 2 and directly import the homemade DVD to Handbrake.) 

**Step 4:** Under the Summary tab, choose MP4 as the output format. Then click the Video tab and make sure the encoder is MPEG-4 or H.264\. 

**Step 5:** Click Save As to set a destination folder on your Mac to save the output MP4 file.  Click the "Start" button and this free DVD to iMovie converter will go into action to convert DVD/VOB to iMovie.
