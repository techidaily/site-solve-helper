### Fix 1\. Check Wi-Fi Network Connection

First thing is the first. To update, download or install apps on iPhone, the essential precondition is the Wi-Fi network connection. Nothing is meaningless if you don't have a stable and strong Wi-Fi network connection. Therefore, just check your Wi-Fi connection and then read on.

### Fix 2\. iPhone Has Enough Space or Not

Actually, needless to emphasize again, everyone knows apps updating need certain free space on iPhone. If you simultaneously update multiple apps, you need to worry if your iPhone has enough space available, esp for 16 & 32GB iPhone users. 

Providing your iPhone is almost full, no space for several apps updates, you can pick out several apps for renewal, not all of them. Or use a iPhone cleaner software like [**MacX MediaTrans**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to free up space on iPhone, like transferring photos, music, videos, ringtones, eBooks, podcast, etc. from iPhone to Mac for eternal backup; delete unwanted photos, movies, etc. to save iPhone storage.
